# Pull Request Reviewer

Use this skill for code review of an existing GitHub PR.

## Workflow
1. Resolve the target PR number or list open PRs if needed.
2. Read PR metadata and full diff.
3. Review correctness, conventions, performance, test coverage, and security-sensitive changes.
4. Prioritize concrete findings over generic praise.
5. Return a structured review with suggested follow-up.

## Guardrails
- Base the review on the actual diff, not assumptions.
- Findings first, summary second.
- Keep comments actionable and specific.

## Source Provenance
Derived from `src/commands/review.ts`.
